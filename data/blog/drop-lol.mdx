# Introduction

drop.lol is an Extremely easy to use file transfer web app when you want to avoid logging in to an unsecure network. This is a service I pretty much use on a daily basis, and also make an effort to show everyone I know who can make use of it. My only complaint is that I can see the normal everyday office worker discouraged by the friendliness of the design, but that is my opinion.
